                <h1>Andora 1-2 Wales - Tuesday 9th September</h1>

                <p>Gareth Bale's late free-kick saved Wales from embarrassment in Andorra as his two goals made it a winning start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. Andorra had stunned Chris Coleman's side by taking a sixth-minute lead through Ildefons Lima's penalty, Andorra's first competitive goal since 2010. Bale headed Wales level 16 minutes later, though that did not spare Coleman the jeers of the furious travelling Welsh fans as the score remained 1-1 at half-time.</p>

                <p>Although a victory of any sort was welcome, the Welsh performance was distinctly unconvincing as they aim to qualify for the finals stage of a major tournament for the first time since the 1958 World Cup.
                   There had been optimism leading up to this campaign, with Euro 2016 expanded from 16 to 24 teams for the first time and Wales drawn alongside Bosnia, Belgium, Israel, Cyprus and Andorra in their qualifying group. Wales could hardly have asked for a kinder opening fixture - a trip to an Andorran side who are ranked 199th in the world, 158 places below them in the standings, and have lost their last 44 competitive games. But to Wales' horror, the prospect of a first competitive win for Andorra since 2004 seemed soberingly real as the hosts took an unexpected lead</p>

                          </table>

                <p>There was more urgency to the Welsh performance after the restart, and Bale was the catalyst for the change in pace. He had a free-kick from distance saved by Ferran Pol and a long-range effort which fizzed just wide, while his cross was headed wide by Andy King. There were times when Wales' desperation to take the lead led to a loss of shape and rhythm, as players struggled to adapt to tactical changes. Coleman continued to tinker - replacing his only striker Simon Church with midfielder Joe Ledley to leave Bale as the most advanced player in a makeshift attack. And when the breakthrough eventually came, it was no surprise that Bale was once again the saviour. After substitute George Williams was fouled 25 yards from goal, Bale whipped the ball brilliantly beyond Pol to spare Coleman and his side a major embarrassment. In the only other match in Group B on Tuesday, Bosnia lost 2-1 at home to Cyprus.</p>
