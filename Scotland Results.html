            <h1>Germany 2 - 1 Scotland - Sunday 7th September</h1>
            
			<p>Scotland's opening Euro 2016 qualifier ended in defeat by world champions Germany thanks to two goals from Thomas Muller.He headed the opener in a first half completely dominated by the hosts.The Scots rode their luck in the first half but lifted their game after the break and levelled through Ikechi Anya. But poor defending allowed Muller to fire in from close range to seal a narrow win, with Charlie Mulgrew sent off in stoppage time for the visitors.</p>
            
            <p> The result is no disgrace and nor was the Scots' performance after half-time, when they seemed to find a belief that they could hurt their illustrious opponents.
And so they did when Sunderland's Steven Fletcher came off the bench and released winger Anya with a wonderful pass.</p>
            
            <p> The Watford player, racing from the halfway line, still had plenty to do but as he approached Manuel Neuer's goal he showed terrific composure to slide the ball into the net. That cancelled out Muller's early opener, which arrived despite two earlier warnings. The German forward had twice got his head to dangerous crosses - the first a bad miss, the second cleared to safety - before the third landed in David Marshall's net.</p>
            
            <p> And though the outcome was a fair one on the balance of play, Scotland did cause numerous problems for a shaky German defence and can take confidence from the way they matched the World Cup winners after the interval.</p>

			<h2>Scotland 1 - 0 Georgia - Saturday 11th October</h2>
    
			<p>Scotland kick-started their European Championship qualifying campaign with a deserved, if far from emphatic, win over Georgia at Ibrox. A powerful shot from Shaun Maloney was saved but then struck Akaki Khubutia to spin into the net for an own goal.
Soon after, an effort from captain Scott Brown deflected narrowly wide.</p>
    
			<p>Georgia failed to test David Marshall but Scotland could not add to their lead, with Giorgi Loria saving from Steven Naismith and James Morrison. Having lost their Group D opener in Germany last month, Scotland could ill afford a slip-up and set a high tempo, with full-backs Alan Hutton and Andy Robertson eager to get forward. Brown, favoured for the captaincy with Darren Fletcher on the bench, and Morrison eagerly took turns to win possession and press forward from midfield. Temuri Ketsbaia's visitors, already beaten at home by the Republic of Ireland, were organised in defence and held firm for almost half an hour but rarely ventured forward. Hull City's Robertson impressed with a series of early crosses for Steven Fletcher, but whether the Sunderland striker was rusty after a lengthy absence from first-team football or simply too eager, he strayed offside too often.</p>

			<h3>Poland 2-2 Scotland Tuesday 14th October</h3>

			<p>A ferociously-struck Arkadiusz Milik equaliser denied Scotland a famous win in Warsaw, but a hard-fought point was an impressive result for the visitors. Poland threw everything at the Scots in the second half after going 2-1 behind to a clever Steven Naismith finish. Earlier, Krzysztof Maczynski's cooly-converted opener was cancelled out by Shaun Maloney's equally calm strike. But Milik earned the Poles a deserved point and Kamil Grosicki almost struck a winner when his effort struck a post. The result ensured Poland kept pace with the Republic of Ireland at the summit of a delicately-poised Group D after Martin O'Neill's side drew 1-1 with Germany.</p>

			<p>The world champions - who were beaten in Warsaw on Saturday - are level with Scotland three points back, with the Irish travelling to Celtic Park in November.
Another surprise appeared to be on the cards when Gordon Strachan's side took the lead early in the second half on Tuesday, but there was to be no repeat of the friendly win in March. There was, however, plenty of poise about Scotland's performance, a trait that is becoming more and more evident under Strachan. And though they were put under significant pressure as the game wore on, a combination of stout defending and poor finishing meant that they left with a point.</p>

			<p> Steven Fletcher switched play to Ikechi Anya on the left and the winger's cutback was slotted expertly past Wojciech Szczesny by Maloney from 10 yards.
Steven Whittaker was a surprise inclusion ahead of Andrew Robertson at left-back but the defender prevented a seemingly certain second Polish goal, nipping in ahead of Lewandowski to clear with the goal gaping. That seemed to have paved the way for Naismith to give the Scots victory when he guided a James Morrison free-kick past Szczesny, but Milik had other ideas, ripping a strike past Marshall after Artur Jedrzejczyk's reverse pass.</p>
