            <h1>England's Road to Euro 2016 Begins England 2 - 0 Switzerland - Monday 8th September</h1>
            
			<p>England made the dream start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign as two second-half strikes from Arsenal's Â£16m Danny Welbeck gave them victory in Switzerland.
Manager Roy Hodgson needed his side to produce an encouraging performance and positive result after the misery of going out of the World Cup in Brazil at the group stage in the summer - and this did the job on both counts.</p>
                
			<p>England were indebted to two vital saves by goalkeeper Joe Hart from Haris Seferovic and a vital goal-line clearance from Gary Cahill, but this victory was fully deserved and showed promising signs for the future.</p>
            
			<p>Switzerland - ninth in Fifa's world rankings  in August after reaching the last 16 of the World Cup, with England 20th - posed a threat but ended up being well beaten. The merits of Hodgson using the diamond formation, which suits Raheem Sterling perfectly, was shown as Liverpool's youngster set up former Manchester United star Welbeck's first goal just before the hour and was also involved as Anfield team-mate Rickie Lambert laid on the striker's second in stoppage time.</p>

			<h3>England 5 - 0 San Marino - Thursday 9th Oct</h3>
    
			<p>England delivered the expected easy win over San Marino at Wembley to maintain their 100% start to the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.</p>
    
			<p>Manager Roy Hodgson has been handed a highly favourable draw in Group E as England attempt to banish the memories of their miserable World Cup - and they are taking full advantage so far. Phil Jagielka headed England in front and Wayne Rooney scored his 42nd England goal from the penalty spot before half-time as San Marino presented barely any serious competition.</p>

			<h3>England 1 - 0 Estonia - Sunday 12th October</h3>

			<p>England laboured to victory over Estonia in Tallinn as Wayne Rooney's late free-kick made it three wins out of three in their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.</p>

			<p>Rooney curled his shot in from just outside the area 17 minutes from the end of a mediocre encounter to give England's captain his 43rd goal for his country - six behind all-time record holder Sir Bobby Charlton. It rescued England as they struggled to break down the stubborn Estonians, who stood firm even after captain Ragnar Klavan had been sent off for a second yellow card three minutes into the second half.</p>

			<p> And it spared manager Roy Hodgson some awkward questions over the omission of Raheem Sterling after Liverpool's teenager admitted he was tired following the 5-0 win against San Marino at Wembley. England monopolised possession but the lack of end product was alarming against opponents who were dogged but hardly an upgrade into the European elite after the stroll against San Marino on Thursday.</p>
